# Artificial-Neural-Networks-with-Keras
Setup :
Firstly, let's import a few common modules, ensure MatplotLib plots figures inline and prepare a function to save the figures. 
We also check that Python 3.5 or later is installed (although Python 2.x may work, it is deprecated so we strongly recommend you use Python 3 instead), 
as well as Scikit-Learn ≥0.20 and TensorFlow ≥2.0.
